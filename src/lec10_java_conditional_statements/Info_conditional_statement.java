Java Operators:
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Classification:
1) Arithmetic Operators: Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus/Remainder
Below 2 will use when we will learn loop
++ Increment
-- Decrement

2) Comparison Operators: Comparison operators are used to compare two values
== Equal to operator
!= Not Equal
> Greater than 
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to

3) Java Logical Operators: Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values

&&  Logical and operator (Returns true if both statements are true, x < 5 &&  x < 10)
||   Logical or operator (Returns true if one of the statements is true, x < 5 || x < 4)
!    Logical not operator (Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true, (!(x < 5 && x < 10))


4) Assignment Operators: (When we learn loop, we will use them)
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
			Example     What does it mean
=         x=5            x=5
+=       x+=3           x=x+3
-=        x-=3           x=x-3
