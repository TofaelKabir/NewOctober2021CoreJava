1) What are the common symbols used in Java? (Please memorize them)?
			(  ) 	  Parentheses
			{  } 	  Curly braces
			[  ] 	  Square bracket
			<  >   Angular bracket
			“  “	 Double Quotation or quotation
			‘  ‘ 	 Single quotation (single must be mentioned)
			/   	 Slash/Single slash
			\    	 Back slash
			;        Semicolon
			=    	 Assign operator
			|        Pipe
			~       Tilde
			%      Modulus
			!        Exclamatory sign

2) Describe the classification of variables?
-- Class Variable 2 type:
		i) Primitive data type variable- eight types - byte, short, int, long, float, double, char or boolean.
		ii) Reference data type variable --- is coming at the end of class

3) Describe primitive type data?

		byte = –128 (2^7) to 127 (2^7-1)  //because of zero, 1 is deducted. (-128 to +127)
		
		short = –32,768 to 32,767   (32768 = 256byte)
		
		int (integer) = –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483, 647     [mostly used]
		
		long = –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807     [highest range, we never used] [we have to use l (small L) at the end]
		
		float = decimal till 6 to 7 digit [example: 3.1415927]   [we have to use f at the end]
		
		double = decimal till 15 to 16 digit [example: 3.1415927410125732] 
		
		String = “Tofael483” [Only variable start with Upper case] [V V Imp interview question: Not a pure primitive type]
		
		char = ‘A’      
		         
		boolean = true or false
		
		Mostly used variables: String, int, char, boolean, double

4) What is the difference between float and double in details?
 -- Though both float and double data type are used to represent floating point numbers in Java, a double data type is more precise than float. A double variable can provide precision up to 15 to 16 decimal points as compared to float precision of 6 to 7 decimal digits. Another significant difference between float and double is their storage requirement, double is more expensive than float. It takes 8 bytes to store a variable while float just takes 4 bytes. Which means, if memory is constraint then its better to use float than double. BTW, the double type also has a larger range than float and if your numbers don't fit well in float then you have to use double in Java.
 
5) What is a class in Java?
-- Class is a blueprint from which -- individual objects are created.

6) Is Java Strongly Typed Language?
-- Yes, Java is a strongly typed language. Reason: Each and every variable must have a declared type. Primitive (int, String, char, boolean, double, short, long, float) and reference type variable.   

7) What is an object in java? (will discuss later)
-- Object is an instance (illustration) of the class and Object is the physical reality.

8) What is constructor in java?
-- A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called just after the memory is allocated for the object.
